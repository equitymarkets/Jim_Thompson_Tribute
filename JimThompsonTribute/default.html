    <p><main>James "Jim " Harrison Wilson Thompson is known for the line of products that bears his name, but lived a life that most people are neither aware of nor appreciate. Born in Delaware in 1906 to a textile manufacturer, Jim excelled academically and by his university years, had gained admittance into the prestigious Princeton University. Jim would graduate and subsequently represent the United States in the 1928 Olympics with the 6 Meter Sailing event. Jim would eventually go to work in architecture, designing houses for weatlthy East Coast families. After World War II erupted, however, Jim felt the need to serve his country in war and joined the National Guard in 1941. Enjoying the same success as with his previous ventures, he quickly rose in the ranks and was appointed to the <i>Office of Strategic Services</i>, or OSS, a predecessor to today's CIA. Several tours into this career, and after the end of World War II, Jim found himself stationed in Southeast Asia. It is there that he built a silk empire, bringing Thai Silk to America and reviving a trade that was, while historically successful, struggling at that time. </main></p><p>By 1950, Jim's silk business was prospering in Thailand and abroad. He would spend the next 17 years doing what he is perhaps best-known for, designing high-end silks for distinguished customers the world over.</p><p>One day in 1967, while on vacation in Malaysia, Jim went for a hike in the jungle never to return. His disappearance is one of the enduring mysteries in the region, as no evidence was ever found to suggest his demise.</p><p>Jim's legacy lives on with his branded line of various designs, a museum, outlet stores, restaurants, and a still thriving silk industry in Thailand.<br><br> </p><hr>
